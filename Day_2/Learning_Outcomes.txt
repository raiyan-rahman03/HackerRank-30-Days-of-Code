**strip**
**operators**


The .strip() method in Python is used to remove leading and trailing whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) from a string. It doesn't remove whitespace characters within the string, only at the beginning and end.

For example:

#####Code#####
text = "   Hello, world!   "
stripped_text = text.strip()
print(stripped_text)  # Output: "Hello, world!"
.strip() is commonly used when processing user input, such as from the input() function, to remove any accidental whitespace characters that the user might have included by pressing space before or after entering text.

In the code snippet you provided, .strip() is used in conjunction with the input() function to remove leading and trailing whitespace from the user's input:

#####Code#####
N = int(input().strip())
This ensures that any leading or trailing whitespace characters are removed before converting the input to an integer using int().
