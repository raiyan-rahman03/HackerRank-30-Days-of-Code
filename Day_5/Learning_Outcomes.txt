**f strings**



This line of code is using an f-string, which is a feature introduced in Python 3.6. An f-string allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, prefixed with an 'f' or 'F', and these expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is evaluated.

In the line you provided:

##Code##

print(f"{n} x {i} = {a}")


{n}, {i}, and {a} are placeholders within the f-string.
n, i, and a are variables whose values will be inserted into the string at those respective locations.
The expression within the curly braces {} will be evaluated and replaced with the corresponding values.
So, when this line of code executes, it will print the value of n followed by " x ", then the value of i, followed by " = ", and finally, the value of a. It's a concise way to format strings with variable values in Python.
