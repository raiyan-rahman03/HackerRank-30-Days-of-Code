Round function 

In Python, the built-in round() function is used to round a number to a specified number of digits after the decimal point. Here's how you can use it:


######Code######
# Syntax: round(number, ndigits)
# number: The number to be rounded.
# ndigits: The number of digits to round to (optional, default is 0).

# Example usage:
x = 3.14159
rounded_x = round(x)  # Rounds to the nearest integer
print(rounded_x)  # Output: 3

y = 3.14159
rounded_y = round(y, 2)  # Rounds to 2 decimal places
print(rounded_y)  # Output: 3.14
In the first example, round(x) rounds the number x to the nearest integer. In the second example, round(y, 2) rounds the number y to 2 decimal places.

If ndigits is not provided, round() returns the nearest integer to the input.
If ndigits is specified, the number is rounded to that many digits after the decimal point.
If ndigits is negative, the number is rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 to the power of ndigits.
